## fashion_poc

This is an analysis of fashion data using Plotly and Dash.

It's just a demo. The brand names are well known but the data is completely synthetic.

This demo is available on Binder, although it takes a long time to load.

I originally put this together as a poc (proof of concept) for a potential client.
